## Common Tasks

This project follows the [GitHub "scripts to rule them all" pattern](http://githubengineering.com/scripts-to-rule-them-all/). The contents of the `scripts` directory are scripts that cover all common tasks:

* `script/setup` &mdash; Performs first-time setup
* `script/update` &mdash; Performs periodic updating
* `script/test` &mdash; Runs automated tests
* `script/server` &mdash; Launches the web server
* `script/console` &mdash; Opens the development console
* `script/db-console` &mdash; Opens the database console for the development database
* `script/docs` &mdash; Generates developer documentation
    * `--open` Opens the documentation in the local web browser after generation
    * `--test` Generates the documentation including test modules and helpers

Other scripts that are available but not intended to be used directly by developers:

* `script/bootstrap` &mdash; Used to do a one-time install of all prerequisites for a development machine
* `script/cibuild` &mdash; Used to run automated tests in the CI environment

### Views

* **DO** name functions beginning with `render` if they render a child template -- example `StaffNotesWeb.UserView.render_user_orgs/1`

### Writing tests

#### Controller tests

* **DO** verify HTTP status
* **DO** verify redirects
* **DO** verify assigns
